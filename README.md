PinLock was created by Eddie Choi and Jonathan Che at CodeSmith LA 23. 

The Purpose: 

PinLock was designed to provide an additional layer of password security when creating user accounts at different domains.
It can be served as an alternative to 2-factor verification.  

The Motivation: 

Many people will utilize the same password for multiple user accounts. The same password that you utilize for your social media accounts may be the same as your bank account passwords. If your password has been compromised for one account, all accounts with the same password are now vulnerable. 

What does PinLock do? 

PinLock will generate a randomized four digit pin for the domain visited. If the pin is not locked in,it will continue to generate a randomized pin each visit. If it is locked in, PinLock will retain the pin number for that specific domain and the pin will be easily accessible by clicking the PinLock icon in the browser. 

How To Use:

PinLock is intended to be used when signing up for a new website. Upon signup, the user can reference the random pin and create a unique password that can be easily remembered.

Example 1:
Domain: Github.com
Random Pin: 4859
Generic Password: ilovetesting
Unique Password: ilovetesting4859

Example 2:
Domain: Codesmith.io
Random Pin: 9283
Generic Password: ilovetesting
Unique Password: ilovetesting9283

Additional Features In Settings:

(RECOMENDED) [IN DEVELOPMENT] PinLock allows the user to save a .txt file containing the URL and Pin, key value pairs stored in local memory so that in the event an individual removes the extension from their browser, they still have a way to access the stored pins.

[IN DEVELOPMENT] PinLock also allows users to set a desired pin in lieu of a randomized pin.# pinlock
